# Capital Gains Calculator

A command-line interface (CLI) application for calculating capital gains.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- TypeScript
- Jest (for testing)
- ESLint (for code linting)
- Prettier (for code formatting)

Typescript was used because it is the language I have the most affinity with, I can guarantee type checking and run it in the terminal easily with nodejs.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the application
npm run build
```

## Running

```bash
# Run the application
npm start
```

## Testing
